# BPSK-Simulation-MATLAB
This MATLAB simulation project evaluated the BER performance of BPSK modulation in AWGN, Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami-m fading channels using Monte Carlo methods. Results showed significant performance variation among channels, with AWGN performing the best and Rayleigh the worst.
